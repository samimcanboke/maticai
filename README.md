# CryptiVest

Introduce our new crypto staking dApp, CryptiVest, the perfect platform for earning passive income on your MATIC holdings. The dApp allows users to stake MATIC for a chosen duration and earn a high annual percentage yield (APY) on their investment. 

Users can easily stake their MATIC from various duration options. Upon completion of the staking period, users can close their position to return their staked MATIC along with the earned interest. However, if a user closes their position before the expiration of the selected duration, they will not receive any interest earned on their investment. 

Our dApp uses a secure and reliable smart contract to keep your staked funds safe and accessible. With our user-friendly interface, anyone can start earning passive income on their MATIC holdings. Start earning a high APY on your MATIC today. 

**Note:** The APY rate and duration options may vary based on market conditions, check the dApp before making a decision
